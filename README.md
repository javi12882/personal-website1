 Description of the work
 The work consists of creating a web page in which there is a home page, with multiple links
 in which the user can choose. In each link there are different things about me, such as my
 user-friendly form to contact with me, a detailed overview of my degree and links to my social
 media accounts

 Problems during the development 
 During the creation of the work I encoutered different problems. As in the creation of the code in visual studio code there were some problems that it took me a time to realize how to do it. Another problem is that all the htmls had to be inside the index.html, which at first was frustrating to link each one to the index.html

 Conclusion
 I think this work makes us realize how a web is created and the basic components a web needs. It makes us get familiar to all of the apps used, such as Visual Studio code, the bash, the repositories
